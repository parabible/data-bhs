# data-bhs

**NOTE: I'm busy working on the pipeline elsewhere so this repo is just in place for now. It'll take a while but I'm working on the data pipeline here: <https://github.com/jcuenod/parabible-data-pipeline>. You'll find content related to the BHS in `/hb-bhs-pipe`**

Build the BHS data needed for parabible's backend.

I'm in the process of changing the backend quite dramatically (to make building a data pipeline easier).

When that's done, I will have stuff to put here...
